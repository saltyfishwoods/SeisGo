Updates in v0.7.2
TYPES:
1. CorrData.subset() changed overwrite to False by default.
2. DvvData, added get_info() to streamline and wrapup key information for other use.
3. DvvData: added save() as a wrapper for saving functions, including to_asdf() and to_pickle.
4. DvvData: added to_pickle() to save data to pickle files. This is mainly aiming to
    workaround with the problem of saving large attributes in h5 file, through asdf.

MONITORING:
1. extract_dvvdata: added option to read in pickle files.
2. get_dvv(): added option to save to pickle.

==================================================================
Changes in v0.7.0
STACKING:
1. Added clusterstack() and tfpws().

MONITORING:
1. Added option to specify file name when saving to *.h5 file.

==================================================================
Updates in v0.6.6
MONITORING:
1. Fixed a bug in single cpu mode, where the positive side was used for the negative measurements.

STACKING:
1. Cleaned up stacking methods with simpler names with a consistent fashion
2. Added seisstack() as a wrapper/interface to call all methods.

TYPES:
1. CorrData.to_egf(): Added a statement to check whether the data is already EGFs.
2. CorrData.stack(): demean is now an option. ampcut can be turned off now. This is to
    consider situations when all data need to be stacked and/or the overall trend needs to be preserved.
3. Simplified calling stacking through seisstack. this enables easier future development.

NOISE:
1. Simplified calling stacking through seisstack. this enables easier future development.

UTILS:
1. Added get_snr() to get snr of data with distance information.
2. Added rms() to get the rms of data.
3. Fixed a bug in psd() to return half of the PSD and the corresponding frequency vector.

==================================================================
Updates in v0.6.5
SETUP:
1. Added requirements for tslearn and minisom mainly for the clustering module .

CLUSTERING:
1. Added the new module.
2. Added clustering of velocity depth profiles with kmean and som, in two functions.

PLOTTING:
1. Added get_color_cycle() to help assign colors in plotting using matplotlib.
2. Cleaned up unused old NOISEPY functions.
3. Function to plot vmodel clustering results.

NOISE:
1. Optimized merge_chunks() to use less time getting the time range.

UTILS:
1. Added option to use pattern in get_filelist().

==================================================================
Updates in v0.6.4
TYPES:
1. Check lower case only for method in CorrData.stack()
2. Bugs and improvements in DvvData and CorrData to save large attribute to asdf
3. Added psd() method in CorrData to plot psd of the CorrData result.
4. Added plot() method in FFTData to plot the amplitude spectrum of the FFT results.
5. Improved plot() for DvvData with smoothing option.
6. Minor bug fixes and improvement for FFTData in merging and plotting.

DOWNLOADERS:
1. Use inventory to remove response in read_data for miniseed
2. Added ms2asdf() to convert miniseed files to asdf files.

NOISE:
1. Optimize memory usage for merge_chunks()

PLOTTING:
1. Added plot_psd() to plot the psd of an array (works with 1-d and 2-d array only for now.)
2. Updated plot_eventsequence() to have the option of plotting depth as the ydata.

UTILS:
1. Minor bug fixes in read_gmtlines()
2. Added psd() to get the power spectral density of an array

==================================================================
Updates in v0.6.3.1
1. Fixed the size issue when saving "time" to ASDF file. HDF file limits the attribute
  size to 64k or less. We split time to time_mean and np.float32(time) to reduce the size.
  This is a temporary fix. Hopefully HDF could lift the size limit for attributes.

==================================================================
Updates in v0.6.3
NOISE
1. Removed ncomp in do_correlation(). Setup a warning message if old usage is used.
2. Change defaults for acorr_only and xcorr_only both to False in do_correlation().
3. Added option to stack in merging(). This option could replace do_stacking() if no
  rotation. Renamed merging() to merge_pairs(). The old name is kept for compatibility.
4. Updated extract_corrdata() to read "side" attribute if available.
5. Added merge_chunks() to merge correlation files, to reduce the number of files, with
  the option for stacking.


DOWNLOADERS
1. Return inventory in get_event_waveforms()
2. Drop duplicates in get_sta_list() and fixed minor bug when channels might be skipped.
3. Change default region to globe in get_events()

UTILS
1. Added mag_duration(), modified from obspyDMT.utils.event_handler.py
2. Renamed qml_to_event_list() to qml2list(). Added option to convert to pandas dataframe.
3. Fixed a bug in slicing_trace(), where the index was float instead of integer.
4. Added get_filelist() and slice_list().
5. Fixed a bug in sclicing_trace() when returning zeros array with errors. changed to return
    empty arrays.

PLOTTING
1. Added plot_eventsequence() to plot event with time.

TYPES
1. Added "side" attribute in CorrData() to mark whether the corrdata is two-sided or one-side only.
2. Revised CorrData.plot() to check "side" attribute when plotting.
3. Added copy() method in CorrData class to allow the user to copy the object, to avoid directly
  modifying the object values.
4. Added split() method in CorrData class to split the negative and positive sides of the data. This
  is needed when the user wants to analyze the two sides separately.
5. Removed ngood attribute from CorrData, corresponding changes have been implemented for other
  functions in "noise".
6. Added subset() method in CorrData() to subset data by time range.
7. Added filter() method in CorrData() to filter corrdata.data.
8. Added DvvData class to store dvv monitoring data.

MONITORING
1. Added get_dvv() as a wrapper to measure dvv with given CorrData object.
2. Added extract_dvvdata() to extract DvvData object from a ASDF file.

OBSMASTER
1. Removed getdata() and deprecated getobsdata(). Data downloading is now handled all by downloaders.
